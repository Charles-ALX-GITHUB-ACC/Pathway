Hello everybody. 
My name is Charles Alfred Koenig. 
I am from Liberia but I currently live in Cyprus. 
I like befriending people. I also like talking to people and helping them to think and feel better. 
I used to be very shy to speak before people. Once I was given an opportunity to speak at a seminar and 
I monster my courage and spoke and I noticed while I spoke, my fear left me and sine I became I have always 
spoke before people regardless of my fear, for I understand that when I take the stage and start speaking, my fear 
will go away. 
I am taking this course to increase my knowledge and understanding of Jesus Christ and the Gospel and to 
strengthen my faith as I walk with the Lord and to be a faithful witness testifying to all people the 
Goodness and great love of God for all humanity. 
The Bible says faith comes by hearing and from hearing the words of God. I think this is als equivalent to 
studying and knowing God's words. The Bible says draw close to God and He will draw close to you. 
One of the ways we can do this is by studying the scriptures especially the Gospel and the life of our Lord 
and Jesus Christ. I understand the more I study scriptures the more informed I am about how to approach God 
the Father almighty and be more expectant of His covenant promises. As it is recorded in the book of John, if 
you remain in me and my words remain in you, ask whatever you want and it will be given to you.
I hope that through this course, I will draw more close and close to God, [myles monroe maximazing your potential].
